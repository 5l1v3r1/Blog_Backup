If you don't have a paypal account or would rather pay in bitcoin here's my address:

**BTC Address:**
17A3opuAYZG45Ebww74QuyG8XWi8iZG31q

Simply once you've paid [email me](mailto:justzero112@gmail.com) the transaction ID & I'll send you the bundle. Note the minimum price in BTC is $10 purely because the operator charges me a fee per transaction. 

If you'd like to pay the minimum or any value above it, you can send BTC to the address above then email me the transaction ID.
